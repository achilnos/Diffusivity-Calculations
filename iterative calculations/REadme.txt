The goal of this program is to model 1D diffusion for a set of difusivites, determined by a range of pressures and temperatures. This proposed structure for this program is: Initiate by running the Plot_iter file. This file defines two vectors. Vector a is the set of all pressure values between the minium and the maxium values at set intervals. Vector b is the set of all temperature values between the maxium and minium values at set intervals. The diffusivty is calculated for each possible pair of values in put into a 2D array, M, of dim len(a) x len(b). Iterativly, the program should take values from this array, and pass them to the calcuation_iter.py, which in turn should pass the diffusivity value to the parameters file, then run through the normal calculation. This value will be returned to Plot_iter.py and added to an array, W, with shape(M). Finally, W will be plotted with a and b as a surfaceplot, or color map, to display graphically the region of runtimes where the measurable diffusion profile exceeds some threshold length.
